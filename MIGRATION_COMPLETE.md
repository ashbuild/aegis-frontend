- **`PaperCard`** - Simplified API with Paper power
- **`PaperFAB`** - Material Design floating action buttons
- **`PaperTextInput`** - Enhanced text inputs with icons and validation

### Direct Paper Usage
Many pages now use Paper components directly for maximum flexibility:
- `Card`, `Text`, `Button`, `Surface`
- `Dialog`, `Portal`, `ActivityIndicator`
- `Avatar`, `List`, `IconButton`, `Divider`

## Key Improvements

### ðŸŽ¨ Visual Enhancements
- **Material Design 3** styling throughout
- **Proper elevation** and shadows on cards
- **Ripple effects** on touchable components
- **Consistent typography** using Paper's text variants
- **Better visual hierarchy** with proper spacing

### â™¿ Accessibility
- **Built-in accessibility** features from Paper components
- **Proper focus management** and screen reader support
- **Touch target sizes** meeting accessibility guidelines
- **High contrast** support in dark mode

### ðŸ”§ Developer Experience
- **TypeScript support** with proper Paper types
- **Consistent API** across all components
- **Better error handling** and validation states
- **Comprehensive documentation** and examples

### ðŸš€ Performance
- **Optimized animations** using Paper's internal optimizations
- **Lazy loading** of dialogs and modals using Portal
- **Efficient re-renders** with proper React patterns

## Migration Benefits

### Before vs After

**Before (Custom Components):**
```tsx
<Button 
  title="Submit" 
  variant="primary" 
  onPress={handleSubmit} 
/>
```

**After (React Native Paper):**
```tsx
<Button 
  mode="contained" 
  onPress={handleSubmit}
>
  Submit
</Button>
```

### Enhanced Features
- **Loading states** built into buttons
- **Error states** in text inputs with proper styling
- **Snackbar notifications** for better user feedback
- **Modal management** with Portal system

## Backward Compatibility

### Gradual Migration Approach
- **Original components preserved** in `components/ui/`
- **Both systems can coexist** during transition
- **No breaking changes** to existing functionality
- **Progressive enhancement** strategy

### Import Options
```tsx
// Original components (still work)
import { Button, Card } from '@/components/ui';

// Paper wrapper components
import { PaperButton, PaperCard } from '@/components/ui';

// Direct Paper components
import { Button, Card } from 'react-native-paper';
```

## Next Steps

### 1. Test the Migration
- Launch your app with `npm run start`
- Test all migrated pages for functionality
- Verify theme switching works properly
- Check accessibility features

### 2. Migrate Remaining Pages
The following pages still use original components and can be migrated:
- `app/(tabs)/chat.tsx`
- `app/(tabs)/history.tsx`
- `app/(tabs)/kitcheniq.tsx`
- `app/(tabs)/walletwatch.tsx`
- Any custom modals or widgets

### 3. Enhance with Paper Features
- Add `Snackbar` for notifications
- Use `Drawer` for navigation
- Implement `BottomSheet` for actions
- Add `SearchBar` for filtering

### 4. Optimize Performance
- Review render patterns
- Optimize animations
- Implement proper loading states
- Add error boundaries

- **Camera/Scan** - `app/(tabs)/scan.tsx`
- **Component Examples** - `components/examples/PaperDashboardExample.tsx`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Theme not applying** - Ensure `PaperProvider` wraps your app
2. **Icons not showing** - Use valid Material Design icon names
3. **TypeScript errors** - Import types from 'react-native-paper'
4. **Performance issues** - Check for unnecessary re-renders

### Getting Help
- Check the console for warnings
- Review the Paper documentation
- Use the example components as reference
- Test on both iOS and Android

## Conclusion
